      <h3>Bio</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Dr. Victor Krumm</b> was once a
        <i>brilliant scientist and philanthropist,</i> but after a series of
        events beyond his control, he became one of the world's
        <mark>most feared supervillains.</mark> Born in a small Eastern European
        town, Victor showed a talent for <ins>science</ins> from a young age and
        quickly rose through the ranks of the academic community. However, his
        life changed forever when his wife and children were killed in a
        <sub>freak accident </sub>caused by one of his experiments gone wrong.
        <sup>Fueled by anger and a desire for revenge</sup>, Victor turned his
        talents towards developing advanced technologies with the goal of
        dominating the world. He has since become the mastermind behind numerous
        world-threatening events, using his vast wealth and scientific knowledge
        to create powerful weapons and hire a team of deadly henchmen.
