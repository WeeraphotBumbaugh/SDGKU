          <b>Dr. Victor Krumm</b> was once a
          <i>brilliant scientist and philanthropist,</i> but after a series of
          events beyond his control, he became one of the world's
          <mark>most feared supervillains.</mark> Born in a small Eastern
          European town, Victor showed a talent for <ins>science</ins> from a
          young age and quickly rose through the ranks of the academic
          community. However, his life changed forever when his wife and
          children were killed in a <sub>freak accident </sub>caused by one of
          his experiments gone wrong.
          <sup>Fueled by anger and a desire for revenge</sup>, Victor turned his
          talents towards developing advanced technologies with the goal of
          dominating the world. He has since become the mastermind behind
          numerous world-threatening events, using his vast wealth and
          scientific knowledge to create powerful weapons and hire a team of
          deadly henchmen.
